# Triangle Counting Algorithms in Graph Streams: A Mathematical Deep Dive

The problem of counting triangles in a graph is fundamental to network analysis, particularly in understanding the structure of social networks. This report explains in detail the mathematical foundations of two significant streaming algorithms for triangle counting: the frequency moment-based approach by Bar-Yossef et al. and the ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling approach by Ahn et al.

Before diving into the algorithms, it's worth noting that the problem of determining whether a graph is triangle-free requires Œ©(n¬≤) space even with constant passes, and more generally, Œ©(m/T‚ÇÉ) space is required for any constant approximation. This makes streaming algorithms that depend on a lower bound t ‚â§ T‚ÇÉ particularly valuable.

## The Vector-Based Framework

Both algorithms use a clever vector representation to transform triangle counting into a problem about frequency moments of a vector. Let's understand this representation:

### Vector Representation

Consider a vector x indexed by all possible triplets T of nodes (subsets of [n] of size 3). For each triplet T, the corresponding entry in x is defined as:

$$ x_T = |\{e \in S : e \subset T\}| $$

This means x_T counts how many edges from the stream S are contained within the triplet T.

For example, in the graph shown in the query (Figure 1), the entries of the vector are:
- x_{1,2,3} = 3 (all three possible edges exist)
- x_{1,2,4} = 1 (only one edge exists)
- x_{1,3,4} = 2 (two edges exist)
- x_{2,3,4} = 2 (two edges exist)

A triplet forms a triangle if and only if its corresponding entry in x equals 3. Therefore, the number of triangles T‚ÇÉ in the graph equals the number of entries in x that equal 3.

## Bar-Yossef et al.'s Algorithm

This algorithm is based on the following key relationship between T‚ÇÉ and the frequency moments of x:

### Frequency Moments and Triangle Counting

The frequency moments of vector x are defined as:

$$ F_k = \sum_T (x_T)^k $$

Lemma 2.1 establishes that:

$$ T_3 = F_0 - 1.5F_1 + 0.5F_2 $$

Let's verify this relation:
- If x_T = 0, contribution to F‚ÇÄ is 0, to F‚ÇÅ is 0, and to F‚ÇÇ is 0. Net contribution to T‚ÇÉ is 0.
- If x_T = 1, contribution to F‚ÇÄ is 1, to F‚ÇÅ is 1, and to F‚ÇÇ is 1. Net contribution: 1 - 1.5 + 0.5 = 0.
- If x_T = 2, contribution to F‚ÇÄ is 1, to F‚ÇÅ is 2, and to F‚ÇÇ is 4. Net contribution: 1 - 3 + 2 = 0.
- If x_T = 3, contribution to F‚ÇÄ is 1, to F‚ÇÅ is 3, and to F‚ÇÇ is 9. Net contribution: 1 - 4.5 + 4.5 = 1.

This elegant formula ensures we count exactly the triangles in the graph[15].

### Error Analysis and Space Complexity

Let TÃÉ‚ÇÉ be the estimate of T‚ÇÉ that results by combining (1 + Œ≥)-approximations of the relevant frequency moments with Lemma 2.1. The error is bounded by:

$$ |TÃÉ_3 - T_3| < \gamma(F_0 + 1.5F_1 + 0.5F_2) \leq 8\gamma mn $$

The inequality follows because max(F‚ÇÄ, F‚ÇÇ/9) ‚â§ F‚ÇÅ = m(n-2), where m is the number of edges and n is the number of vertices.

To achieve a (1 + Œµ)-approximation, we set Œ≥ = Œµ/(8mn), resulting in a space complexity of:

$$ \tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}(mn/t)^2) $$

This algorithm uses existing frequency moment estimation techniques that can (1 + Œ≥)-approximate each moment in √ï(Œ≥‚Åª¬≤) space[15].

## Ahn et al.'s More Space-Efficient Algorithm

Ahn et al. proposed a more space-efficient approach using the ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling technique.

### ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ Sampling Technique

The ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling method uses O(polylog n) space and returns a random non-zero element from vector x. This technique is crucial for the algorithm's efficiency[3].

### Algorithm Details

1. Sample a random non-zero element from vector x
2. Let X ‚àà {1, 2, 3} be the value of this element
3. Define Y = 1 if X = 3 and Y = 0 otherwise
4. Note that E[Y] = T‚ÇÉ/F‚ÇÄ, making Y an unbiased estimator for the ratio of triangles to non-zero entries

By the Chernoff bound, the mean of √ï(Œµ‚Åª¬≤(mn/t)) independent copies of Y equals (1 ¬± Œµ)T‚ÇÉ/F‚ÇÄ with high probability. Multiplying this by an approximation of F‚ÇÄ yields a good estimate of T‚ÇÉ[3].

### Space Complexity

This algorithm achieves a space complexity of:

$$ \tilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}(mn/t)) $$

This represents a significant improvement over Bar-Yossef et al.'s algorithm, requiring only √ï(Œµ‚Åª¬≤(mn/t)) space rather than √ï(Œµ‚Åª¬≤(mn/t)¬≤)[3].

## Mathematical Foundation of the Algorithms

The mathematical foundation of these algorithms involves:

1. **Vector representation**: Transforming the graph problem into a vector problem
2. **Polynomial interpolation**: The relation T‚ÇÉ = F‚ÇÄ - 1.5F‚ÇÅ + 0.5F‚ÇÇ can be viewed as a polynomial interpolation problem. We want a polynomial f(x_T) that equals 0 when x_T ‚àà {0,1,2} and equals 1 when x_T = 3. This would normally require a degree 3 polynomial, but F‚ÇÄ gives an extra degree of freedom, allowing a degree 2 polynomial to suffice[15].
3. **Frequency moment estimation**: Using streaming algorithms to approximate F‚ÇÄ, F‚ÇÅ, and F‚ÇÇ
4. **‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling**: A technique to sample non-zero coordinates of a vector maintained implicitly in a stream
5. **Concentration bounds**: Using Chernoff bounds to analyze the accuracy of the estimator based on random sampling

## Advantages of Ahn et al.'s Algorithm

The algorithm by Ahn et al. has a key advantage: it is applicable in dynamic settings where edges can be both inserted and deleted, which wasn't possible with earlier algorithms like Buriol et al.[3]

## Conclusion

These algorithms represent significant breakthroughs in space-efficient triangle counting for streaming graphs. The vector-based approach translates the graph problem into a problem about frequency moments, enabling the application of streaming algorithms for moment estimation. The ‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling technique further improves space efficiency.

The dependency on the lower bound t is crucial - as t approaches T‚ÇÉ, the space requirements decrease substantially, making these algorithms highly practical when a good lower bound is known or when the actual number of triangles is large.

Sure! Let's break this algorithm down in simpler terms. The problem at hand is:

### **Goal: Count the number of triangles (`T‚ÇÉ`) in a graph using sublinear space in a streaming setting.**

---

### üìå **Context:**
- **Triangle**: A set of 3 nodes where each pair is connected by an edge.
- **Why triangles matter**: Triangles indicate social cohesion in networks. They‚Äôre used in metrics like **transitivity** and **clustering coefficient**.
- The challenge is doing this in **streaming model**‚Äîwhere you see edges one by one and can‚Äôt store the whole graph.

---

## üß† **High-Level Idea**

### üîπ 1. **Vector-Based Representation**
We define a vector **x**, where:
- Each index **T** in **x** represents a **triple of nodes** (subset of size 3).
- `x_T` is the **number of edges among the 3 nodes** in T (can be 0, 1, 2, or 3).
- If `x_T = 3`, then **T forms a triangle**.

So, counting triangles = counting how many entries in **x** equal 3.

> ‚úÖ Key Insight: Turn triangle counting into a **frequency moment problem** on vector x.

---

### üîπ 2. **Use Frequency Moments**
Bar-Yossef et al. showed that:
```
T‚ÇÉ = F‚ÇÄ - 1.5 * F‚ÇÅ + 0.5 * F‚ÇÇ
```
Where:
- `F‚ÇÄ` = number of non-zero entries in x.
- `F‚ÇÅ` = sum of all x_T values.
- `F‚ÇÇ` = sum of squares: ‚àë x_T¬≤

You can **approximate F‚ÇÄ, F‚ÇÅ, F‚ÇÇ** using standard sketching algorithms in **sublinear space**, then plug into the formula.

> üí° These are known as **frequency moments**. They capture different "views" of the data distribution.

---

### üîπ 3. **Accuracy & Space Bounds**
By using (1 ¬± Œ≥)-approximations for `F‚ÇÄ`, `F‚ÇÅ`, `F‚ÇÇ`, and carefully bounding errors, they show:
```
| TÃÉ‚ÇÉ - T‚ÇÉ | ‚â§ 8Œ≥mn
```
So by choosing Œ≥ small enough (based on your error tolerance Œµ), you get:
```
Space ‚âà √ï(Œµ‚Åª¬≤ (mn/t)¬≤)
```
Here:
- `m` = number of edges,
- `n` = number of nodes,
- `t` = a **lower bound** on the number of triangles.

---

### üîπ 4. **L‚ÇÄ Sampling Approach (More Efficient)**
Ahn et al. proposed a smarter method using **‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling**, which lets you:
- Pick a **random non-zero** element from x in polylogarithmic space.
- Then look at whether its value is 3 (i.e., it represents a triangle).
- Do this multiple times and estimate the **fraction of samples** that are triangles.

This gives an estimate of `T‚ÇÉ / F‚ÇÄ`. Multiply by an estimate of `F‚ÇÄ` to get `T‚ÇÉ`.

> üéØ Think of it like **polling random triples** and seeing how many are triangles.

**This works even if the graph has edge deletions**, which makes it **very versatile**.

---

### ‚úÖ **Summary**
- Represent triangle counts as a frequency vector over triples of nodes.
- Use **frequency moments** (F‚ÇÄ, F‚ÇÅ, F‚ÇÇ) to derive a formula for triangle count.
- Approximate moments with sketches to save space.
- Alternatively, use **‚Ñì‚ÇÄ sampling** to sample and estimate triangle proportion.
- All of this works in **streaming** settings with limited memory.
